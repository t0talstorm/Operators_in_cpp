# EXPERIMENT – 3
# Aim: To study and implement operators in C++.

## Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz Online Compiler

## Theory:
In this experiment, we explored how different types of operators (logical and relational) are used in C++ along with conditional statements like if, else if, and else to make decisions based on user input.

### Program 1:
The first program asks the user to input any integer and then checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- If the number is greater than 0, it prints “Number is POSITIVE.”
- If the number is less than 0, it prints “Number is NEGATIVE.”
- If it’s equal to 0, the program prints “Number is ZERO.”
- This helps in understanding how simple conditional logic works with integers.

### Program 2:
The second program takes marks for five subjects — DCLD, NT, EDC, SnS, and MTT — and calculates the average. Based on that average, it assigns a grade using if-else conditions.
Here’s how the grading system is structured:

- O Grade: 90 to 100
- A+ Grade: 80 to 89
- A Grade: 70 to 79
- B Grade: 60 to 69
- C Grade: 50 to 59
- FAIL: Below 50

If the average is not within the valid range (0–100), the program displays an error message asking for valid marks.

### Program 3:
This program determines the position of a point (x, y) on the 2D Cartesian plane based on the coordinates entered by the user.
It checks for all the possible positions using if-else conditions:

- 1st Quadrant: x > 0 and y > 0
- 2nd Quadrant: x < 0 and y > 0
- 3rd Quadrant: x < 0 and y < 0
- 4th Quadrant: x > 0 and y < 0
- On X-axis: y = 0 and x ≠ 0
- On Y-axis: x = 0 and y ≠ 0
- At Origin: x = 0 and y = 0

Based on the condition, the program prints where the point lies.

## Conclusion:
By writing and running these three programs, we learned how to apply logical and relational operators in C++ and how decision-making statements help us generate different outputs based on input values.
